# Original Work Notice

## About This Folder

This folder is part of my ongoing journey of learning and mastering C++.  
I started studying C++ to strengthen my problem-solving skills and prepare for future software development projects. Over time, I have consistently practiced writing small programs, experimenting with new concepts, and documenting everything in separate files.

Every file in this folder represents a step in my learning — from basic syntax to loops, functions, arrays, problem-solving patterns, and more advanced logic.  
These 280+ files reflect my discipline, curiosity, and daily effort.

## Continuous Progress

I will **continuously add more C++ learning files, solved problems, new concepts, and practice tasks** to this repository.  
This repo acts as a timeline of my real growth — not a one-time upload. It shows my steady improvement and long-term commitment to learning C++.

## Important Warning

Some code files in this repository contain **revealed information**, such as author details, project-specific data, or internal comments.  
Because of this:

⚠️ **Copy-pasting these files directly may expose information about the original owner (me).**  
⚠️ **This makes it easy to detect copied work or attempts to claim this project as someone else's.**

Please be mindful and respectful when using this repository.

## Purpose of This Repository

I created this repository to:

- Track and document my genuine learning progress  
- Stay consistent by practicing coding regularly  
- Build a transparent record of my improvements  
- Share my journey with others in an honest way  
- Create a well-organized archive of all my C++ practice files  

This is a representation of my continuous hard work and discipline — not a random dump of files.

## Usage Guidelines (Important)

You are welcome to **read, learn from, or take inspiration** from this code.

However:

❌ **Do NOT re-upload this code as your own**  
❌ **Do NOT claim this work as your personal learning journey**  
❌ **Do NOT copy these files to present as your own creations**  
❌ **Do NOT redistribute without proper credit**  

✔️ You *may* use this project as a reference for your own learning.

All work in these folders is original and part of my personal C++ learning roadmap under **BinaryOxide**.

Thank you for respecting my effort.
